Welcome to our awesome team! Here we'll be explaining everything you must know of the workflow for every project in Flyve MDM.

Starting from the basics we include Awesome tips: <img src="{{ '/images/picto-information.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Awesome tips:" height="16px"> and Watch outs: <img src="{{ '/images/picto-warning.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Watch out:" height="16px"> to get the most of it.

## Git + GitHub

We keep our projects in repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/), one of the biggest host of source code in the world, and use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as our version control system.

Therefore, you must open a new account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), in order to start contributing.

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-information.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Awesome tips:" height="16px"> Git provides the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), available in several languages, and [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1), a 15 min tutorial, both very helpful if you're starting with SCM.

## Setting things up

For security reasons, we demand our members to have enabled the following Authentication measures. The instructions to configure each one are available from the GitHub Help Documentation, this assures us that any change added to any of our repositories comes from an authorized member of our team.

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-information.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Awesome tips:" height="16px"> We strongly recommend to configure your GitHub account and Git locally, if you are a collaborator, it will increase security to your account and work.

### Two Factor Authentication

This is the easiest step, you only need to follow the GitHub Documentation, [Securing your account with 2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/), there are several methods to do this, for example by [SMS Text](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-text-message/) or a [TOTP app](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/).

### SSH

Follow the GitHub guide, [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/), there is everything you need to know to successfully add your SSH key.

### GPG signing

This configuration requires some patience, here is the guide from GitHub, [Signing commits with GPG](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/).

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-information.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Awesome tips:" height="16px"> Use [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) to generate and export your GPG key, it'll make things easier.

## Getting started with Contributing

From the <a href="https://github.com/flyve-mdm/android-mdm-agent/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Contributing Guidelines</a> you'll learn every step to contribute, from making an issue to closing them, using the [Git Flow](http://git-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org/) and the tools we implement.

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-warning.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Watch out:" height="16px"> The guidelines are mandatory for Contributors, Maintainers and Collaborators.

## Continuos Integration

To speed things up and as part of our quality control, we count with automatic processes to run tests for the Pull Requests in our projects and to generate/update the information in the Development section on our gh-pages branches.

### Merges in ```Develop branch```

Every time a merge is made in develop the following documentation is generated or updated.

* Code Documentation: the description of every class and function of the source code.
* Coverage: the coverage of the code according to the tests.
* Test Report: the report thrown after all the tests are run.

### Merges in ```Master branch```

But when the merge is in master:

* Changelog: the list of commits that either add a fix or a feature, since the last stable version released.
* Releases: create a GitHub release.

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-warning.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Watch out:" height="16px"> We follow the [Standard version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for changelogs and the [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the releases.

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-warning.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Watch out:" height="16px"> According to the projects they might have other deployment tasks besides the ones previously described, you should read the README.md in every ```ci``` directory to know their specific workflow.
