## <a name="1"></a>1. Invitation - Enrollment

The Android Agent works in conjuction with the [Web MDM Dashboard](http://flyve.org/web-mdm-dashboard/) and [Flyve MDM plugin](http://flyve.org/glpi-plugin/) for GLPI.

To enroll the devices, the owner of the device must be invited from the Web Dashboard or GLPI plugin, the invitation contains a deeplink or QR code.

The deeplink or QR code contains some base64 encoded semicolon separated fields like a CSV format:

* the URL of the backend for REST API requests
* a user API token belonging to a human user account
* an invitation token
* the name of the company's helpdesk
* the phone number of the company's helpdesk
* the website of the company's helpdesk
* the email of the company's helpdesk

All fields related to the helpdesk may not be populated by the administrators. The fields are ordered.

Once the user receives the email with the invitation and opens the link with the MDM Agent, the user will be able to provide the information requested.

## <a name="2"></a>2. Management

The management of your mobile fleet is through the Flyve MDM Dashboard or GLPI plugin, from there the Administrator of the IT infrastructure applies the policies required to the fleet while the Agent implements them on the devices.

Through the MQTT, a Machine to Machine (M2M) protocol, the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend, thanks to the concepts of will and testament of the protocol.

When there is a connectivity with the broker the Agent will have an Online status and will be able to send a message to the broker, when it is disconnected the broker will send an Offline status on behalf of the Agent.

### 2.1 Files and Apps

Once the Fleet is applied with the deployment of the apps and files, the Agent will receive a MQTT message with the information to start the download using an HTTP request.

## <a name="3"></a>3. User information

You can only update the user information from the Agent, such as phone number, name and emails.

## <a name="4"></a>4. Unenrollment

To unenroll an Agent, a MQTT message is sent to the device running this agent to process unenrollment. Once the unenrollment is done, the agent sends a MQTT message to acknowledge the unenrollment request.

The backend waits for this acknowledgment to actually delete the agent from the database. The delay to send this acknowledgement is undetermined but should happen because the device is in the end of a cycle but still owned by legitimate user and is used in normal operations.
