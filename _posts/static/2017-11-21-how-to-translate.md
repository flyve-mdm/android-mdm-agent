### I know a lot of languages

Great! You can help us translating the project. We are currently translating to Korean, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese.

### But wait, I'm an expert in a different language

If you are an expert in other language we are not currently translating, you can request this language in Transifex and help us to reach more customers in their own language.

### Let's Translate
